`ogr2ogr -f "KML" regions.kml baselayers/NPL_adm/NPL_adm1.shp -sql "select NAME_1 as Region from NPL_adm1"`

`ogr2ogr -f "geojson" regions.json baselayers/NPL_adm/NPL_adm1.shp -sql "select NAME_1 as Region from NPL_adm1"`

`ogr2ogr -f "KML" zones.kml baselayers/NPL_adm/NPL_adm2.shp -sql "select NAME_1 AS Region, NAME_2 AS Zone from NPL_adm2"`

`ogr2ogr -f "geojson" zones.json baselayers/NPL_adm/NPL_adm2.shp -sql "select NAME_1 AS Region, NAME_2 AS Zone from NPL_adm2"`


The district kml and geojson data files are created from NPM_adm3.shp

`ogr2ogr -f "KML" districts.kml baselayers/NPL_adm/NPL_adm3.shp -sql "select NAME_1 AS Region, NAME_2 AS Zone, NAME_3 as District from NPL_adm3"`

`ogr2ogr -f "geojson" districts.json baselayers/NPL_adm/NPL_adm3.shp -sql "select NAME_1 AS Region, NAME_2 AS Zone, NAME_3 as District from NPL_adm3"`

`ogr2ogr -f "KML" kapilvastu.kml NPL_adm4.shp -sql "select NAME_2 AS ZONE,NAME_3 AS DISTRICT, NAME_4 AS VDC from NPL_adm4 where NAME_3='Kapilbastu'"`

`ogr2ogr -f "GeoJSON" kapilvastu.json NPL_adm4.shp -sql "select NAME_2 AS ZONE,NAME_3 AS DISTRICT, NAME_4 AS VDC from NPL_adm4 where NAME_3=â€˜Kapilbastu'"`
